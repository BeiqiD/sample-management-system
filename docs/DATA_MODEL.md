# Data model

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `samples` | A physical wafer, chip, piece, or other tracked item. Self-reference represents parent/child splitting. |
| `events` | Append-oriented timeline records: creation, comments, images, location/status changes, and run-step activity. |
| `recipe_families` | Stable identity shared by successive versions of one recipe. |
| `step_definitions` | SHA-256-addressed instructions; order and version are deliberately excluded from the hash. |
| `state_representations` | SHA-256-addressed expected sample states, currently represented by ordered diagram assets. |
| `template_versions` | Imported or cloned versions with an ordered manifest of logical step, definition, and expected-state hashes. |
| `runs` | Ordered processing segments for one physical sample, linked through predecessor and anchor step. |
| `run_plan_revisions` | Immutable records of which recipe version governed the unfinished plan at each revision. |
| `run_steps` | The actual execution chain. Recipe-derived rows reference definitions; corrections are nullable overrides and ad-hoc rows are explicit actual steps. |
| `run_step_plan_links` | Links recipe plan entries to stable actual run-step identities across plan revisions. |
| `run_step_assets` | Execution and observed-state images uploaded during fabrication. |
| `state_verifications` | Sparse observed-state anchors connected to the previous verification. |
| `state_verification_steps` | Immutable snapshot of the actual steps covered by a verification interval. |
| `imports` | Pending/ready/failed state for one confirmed FabuBlox workbook import. |
| `assets` | R2 object metadata and readiness state for imported and ordinary uploads. |
| `template_steps` | Ordered logical references from a recipe version to hashed definitions and expected states. |

R2 object keys are stored in D1. The bucket stays private and the Worker returns assets only through application routes. Exporters must replace those keys with relative paths inside the resulting ZIP.

Location, lifecycle status, and pinned changes are recorded by database triggers. This makes the current value and its append-only timeline entry part of the same statement. The update API also requires the caller's last-seen `updated_at` value and rejects stale writes.

Ordinary uploads are registered after the R2 write succeeds; a failed registration removes the object. The full export covers every database table and the union of registered assets plus imported source workbook and manifest keys.

New `assets` rows carry a SHA-256 protected by a partial unique index. Imports resolve the workbook, normalized manifest, and every embedded image against that index before writing R2; duplicates within one upload are also collapsed. Rows created before this migration retain a null hash until a future maintenance backfill, so deduplication is guaranteed for newly received content.

Validated Cloudflare Access email addresses are stored on events and other mutable/imported records. Older rows created before the attribution migration remain valid with a null actor.

`last_mutation_id` values are internal concurrency tokens. They allow dependent event inserts to prove that the preceding conditional update succeeded within the same transactional batch.

`samples.process_revision` is retained only for compatibility with the deployed alpha schema. Current concurrency control uses `updated_at` and `last_mutation_id`; application writes no longer increment the legacy column. Removing it should be a future explicit migration rather than an edit to the already-deployed initial migration.

`recipe_change_proposals` stores evidence opened by mismatched state verification. It is included in full export and prevents referenced template history from being deleted, but it does not yet have a review interface.

A recipe version is a statement of what should happen and what state should result. A run records what did happen. `run_step_plan_links` connect those two views without treating an execution correction as a recipe edit.

Plan updates align logical step keys first and exact definition hashes second. Executed entries cannot be removed, changed, or preceded by newly inserted planned work. Compatible future entries retain their run-step IDs, new entries are appended after the execution head, and displaced unfinished entries remain auditable as superseded.

Deleting an unused template version removes its version and ordered step rows. Import provenance and content-addressed assets are retained because they may be shared; an assigned version is archived instead of deleted so run and plan history remain resolvable.

Verification is not inferred from `done`. A user may verify after any step once every current step in the interval is done or skipped. The verification stores its predecessor and an explicit ordered coverage snapshot; a mismatch also opens recipe-change evidence without mutating the recipe.
